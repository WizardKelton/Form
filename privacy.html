            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy page. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information when you use our services.</p>
            
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.
